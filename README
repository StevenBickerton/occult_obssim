Dependencies
---------------

occultTools
cAnanlysis

Install:
----------------

Add the perl modules to PERL5LIB variable.  In the occultation sim directory (i.e. this directory):

$ export PERL5LIB=$PWD/libperl


Running:
-----------------

== choosing the star catalog ==

The catalog of stars is in the file (by default, a test file with only 2 stars!):

star_catalog.dat

The stars for M35 are in the file (just copy this file to 'star_catalog.dat' to run with M35):

sung1999_MNRAS.306.361.dat (~ 1000 stars)


== Running ==

This should just work:
(with default, it only runs 2 stars and takes about 1 minute ... do this as a test!)

$ ./run.sh

Most parameters you might want to tweak are in this short bash script
'run.sh'.  For example, you very likely want to choose the aperture
diameter of your telescope, or set the distance to your target
cluster.  Such settings are in this file.

By default, evalTarget.pl has hard-coded distances to the TNOs (40 AU
and 300 AU).  This determines which diffraction shadows will be
planted/detected.  To change this, you have to edit the script
directly (sorry), but the settings are near the top of the script.


Results:
--------------------

== The rate_* files ==

Final results will be written to files named for each set of parameters you ran:

rate_DDDD_A.AAA       ******* THIS IS THE OUTPUT FILE WITH THE FINAL RESULTS IN IT *********

DDDD  = distance assumed to TNOs (set in evalTarget.pl)
A.AAA = aperture of primary mirror

Using the default parameters should produce the following:

$ cat rate_0040_0.950
#Aper       rate   n*  Vlim   AU        n/s       n/yr      --
0.950  6.217e-09    2 14.50   40  1.609e+08      0.196      -1

Aper   = Telescope aperture
rate   = number of occultations per second
n*     = number of stars used
Vlim   = faintest magnitude for which the expectation rate > 0
AU     = distance to TNO
n/s    = expect wait time between occultations in seconds
n/yr   = number of occultations per year


== The starRates_* files ==

Results for each star in your cluster (i.e. from star_catalog.dat) are in a files called:

starRates_DDDD_A.AAA

DDDD  = distance assumed to TNOs (set in evalTarget.pl)
A.AAA = aperture of primary mirror (set in run.sh)

Using the default parameters should produce the following:

$ cat starRates_0040_0.950
#MK  Teff  Code     RMS R*_Fsu  aper      rate1   Nmk      rateN rateN/y    AU   bmax   rmin      n_m2      nSas   vRet  fsu      --
A8V  7580  2.80  0.0168    0.2 0.950   4.07e-09     1   4.07e-09  0.1284    40 2529.7  421.7         0    0.0239  25076 642      -1
F2V  6890  3.20  0.0276    0.1 0.950  2.147e-09     1  2.147e-09  0.0678    40 1614.1  493.3         0    0.0175  25076 642      -1


MK      = Star's MK type
Teff    = Star's Effective temp.
Code    = A numerical version of MK type (used only internally)
RMS     = RMS noise level in the lightcurve produce by this star type
R*_Fsu  = Projected radius of the star in Fresnel Scale units (FSU).
aper    = telescope aperture
rate1   = The expectation rate for detections with 1 (one) star of this type.
Nmk     = The number of stars of this type in the catalog
rateN   = The expectation rate for all stars of this type (rate1*Nmk) in number/second
rateN/y = rateN expressed in number/year
AU      = assumed distance to TNO
bmax    = the largest occultation impact parameter which is detectable at rmin
rmin    = the smallest radius TNO which is detectable
n_m2    = density of TNOs with radius >= rmin, units number/m^2
nSas    = density of TNOs with radius >= rmin, units number/arcsec^2
vRet    = retrograde velocity for occultation with the specified observing parameter (set in run.sh)
fsu     = Fresnel scale unit for this lambda,distance [metres].

This rates in rate_0040_0.950 are a summary (a sum!) of the rates for all stars in this file.


== In the MK star directories (e.g. A8V/) ==

The results of repeatedly adding/detecting occultation patterns to lightcurves are stored in files:

tsA.AAA.DDDD.fits.stats

For the default, this is ts0.950.0040.fits.stats.  So, for this star
type (e.g. A8V star), with a 0.95m aperture, the detectability of TNO
at 40 AU is stored.  It's plain text, and just lists the number
added/detected in the timeseries at different impact parameters.  The
best way to comprehend detectability for a given star is to view this
file with the rip_snr script (with the occultTools).

$ rip_snr A8V/ts0.950.0040.fits.stat 10

<pops open a window showing a plot>

SNR colored    Impact_parameter   vs.   TNO_Radius
--> very informative.  Shows 'sigma' of a detection for range
    of TNO sizes and occultation impact parameters
